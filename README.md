# Pyrite

A game engine focused on heavily on modularity and extensibility, especially with the editor.

### Main Focus

- **Modularity** - often times engines have very opinionated workflows, we avoid that by providing a highly modular
  system.
- **Ease of use** - we want to be highly customizable while still being simple enough to develop quickly.

### Current State

Pyrite is in a very early stage of active development and is being built mainly for a future game. The main focus of the
engine though is to allow for future games to quickly be made from it. With these points in mind, performance and
developer experience are the main factors for consideration currently.

### Thanks

This project was inspired mainly by [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) for showing what rust is capable of
providing in the context of game development. Bevy also inspired some neat patterns that rust allows for and the general
project structure.
